# Parroter

Parroter provides a control panel for your Parrot Zik 3 on windows. This unofficial application was necessary because the official [Parrot Audio Suite](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/parrot-audio-suite/9wzdncrdjq4f) only has support for Parrot Zik 1.

## Installing

You need to be able to connect your Parrot Zik 3 through bluetooth with your windows machine before using Parroter.
